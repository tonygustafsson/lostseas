# Lost Seas (Next)

This is a new take on the [old Lost Seas game](https://github.com/tonygustafsson/lostseas). It is a multiplayer game where you can sail around the world and fight enemies and collect wealth.

It is built with NextJS, TypeScript, Firebase, Tailwind and DaisyUI.

It is super early in development and there is not much to see yet. But if you want to try it out, you can.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Get a Firebase account and setup correct credentials in a `.env` file
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

Viola.
